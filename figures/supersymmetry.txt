Simulation results for the global supersymmetry model Eq.~(\ref{eq:supersymmetry:Vslow}). All 179 points shown are consistent with experimental data on $r$ and $n_s$. Here $q = 5$, $G_1 = G_2 = G_3 = 0$, $G_4 = 1$, $G_5 \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-0.88931, -0.88920\right)$, where $\mathcal{U}$ refers to a uniform distribution. We set $B = 1$, as it only affects the time scale of inflation, but not the values of $n_s$, $r$, and $f_e$. Finally, $f / M_\text{P} \sim \mathcal{U}\left(0, 1\right)$, $b_{-, 0} \sim \mathcal{U}\left(0, \pi \sqrt{2} f\right)$, $N_\text{pivot} \sim \mathcal{U}\left(50, 60\right)$.
