  Coherent Enhancement of the Axion Decay Constant in Inflation and the Weak Gravity Conjecture

\textbf{Abstract:}
Models of axion inflation based on a single cosine potential require the axion decay constant to be super-Planckian in size.
However, a super-Planckian axion decay constant is disfavored in quantum gravity and in strings, and by the weak gravity conjecture.
Here we propose a coherent enhancement mechanism which can produce an effective axion decay constant which is super Planckian even if the true decay constant is sub Planckian.
We discuss the utility of this mechanism for a variety of axion potentials originating in supersymmetry, supergravity, and strings.
The coherent enhancement mechanism allows one to reduce an inflation model with an arbitrary potential to an effective model of natural inflation, i.e. with a single cosine, by expanding the potential near an inflationary point, and matching the expansion coefficients to those of natural inflation.
We demonstrate that this approach can predict the number of e-foldings in a given inflation model without the need for numerical simulation.
Further we show that the effective decay constant $f_e$ can be directly related to the spectral indices so that $f_e = M_\text{P} / \sqrt{1 - n_s - r / 4}$ where $n_s$ is the spectral index for curvature perturbations and $r$ is the ratio of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations and curvature perturbations.
The current data on $n_s$ and $r$ constrains the effective axion decay constant so that $4.9 \leq f_e / M_\text{P} \leq 10.0$ at $95\%$ CL.
Thus an important result of the analysis is that the effective axion decay constant has an upper limit of $\sim 10 M_\text{P}$ in units of Planck mass in axion cosmology for any potential-based model which produces successful inflation.
The coherent enhancement mechanism for the generation of an effective $f_e > M_\text{P}$ while the true axion decay constant $f < M_\text{P}$ is discussed.
We illustrate the coherent enhancement in globally supersymmetric models and supergravity models.
We also show that $f_e$ based on inflation dynamics can be defined for non-potential-based models, and consider a Dirac-Born-Infeld model as an example.
In each case, all the moduli are stabilized and the inflationary model consistent with astrophysical observations with $f_e > M_\text{P}$ and the true axion decay constant $f < M_\text{P}$ consistent with the weak gravity conjecture.

\section{Introduction \label{sec:Introduction}}
As is well known many of the problems associated with Big Bang cosmology which include
the flatness problem, the horizon problem, and the monopole problem are resolved by inflation~\cite{Guth:1980zm, Starobinsky:1980te, Linde:1981mu, Albrecht:1982wi, Sato:1980yn, Linde:1983gd}.
Quantum fluctuations at the time of horizon exit carry significant information regarding specifics of the inflationary model~\cite{Mukhanov:1981xt, Hawking:1982cz, Starobinsky:1982ee, Guth:1982ec, Bardeen:1983qw, Cheung:2007st} which can be extracted from cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation anisotropy.
The data from the Planck experiment~\cite{Akrami:2018vks, Akrami:2018odb, Array:2015xqh} has helped constrain inflation models excluding some and narrowing down the parameter space of others.
One such model is so-called natural inflation based on a $U(1)$ shift symmetry which is described by a simple potential~\cite{Freese:1990rb, Adams:1992bn} $V\left(a\right) = \Lambda^4 \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{b}{f}\right)\right)$, where $a$ is the axion field and $f$ is the axion decay constant.
In this case, consistency with Planck data requires the axion decay constant to be significantly greater than the Planck mass $M_\text{P}$.
However, an axion decay constant larger than the Planck mass is undesirable since a global symmetry is not preserved by quantum gravity unless it has a gauge origin.
Additionally string theory prefers the axion decay constant to lie below $M_\text{P}$~\cite{Banks:2003sx, Svrcek:2006yi}.
It turns out that the reduction of the decay constant poses a problem, and several suggestions exist regarding its resolution such as the so-called alignment mechanism~\cite{Kim:2004rp, Long:2014dta}.

A procedure for resolving the axion decay constant problem was proposed in~\cite{Nath:2017ihp}.
One element of this analysis relies on a decomposition of the potential into a fast-roll and a slow-roll parts where the slow roll is controlled only by the inflaton field while the remaining fields enter in fast roll and are not relevant for inflation~\cite{Nath:2017ihp} (for a review of inflation in supersymmetric theories see, e.g.,~\cite{Nath:2016qzm}).
An analysis within this model shows that one can obtain spectral indices as well as the ratio of the tensor to the scalar power spectrum consistent with the Planck data~\cite{Akrami:2018vks, Akrami:2018odb, Array:2015xqh}.

The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows.
In section \ref{sec:Alignment} we give a brief introduction to the alignment mechanism.
In section \ref{sec:CoherentEnhancement} we discuss the coherent enhancement mechanism when the potential consists of a superposition of cosines which is typically the case for axionic potentials we consider.
We exhibit the coherent enhancement in various settings.
Thus in section \ref{sec:Supersymmetry} we discuss this mechanism in globally supersymmetric models, and in section \ref{sec:Supergravity} for supergravity models.
In section \ref{sec:DBI}, we discuss the Dirac-Born-Infeld case, in which inflation is not controlled by the potential alone but by the full Lagrangian.
However, an effective decay constant $f_{eH}$ can still be defined based on inflation dynamics.
In section \ref{sec:r}, we discuss the mechanism by which ratios $r$ of tensor-to-scalar power spectra are necessarily small in global supersymmetry and supergravity models we considered, and why they can be as large as experimental limit in DBI.
In section \ref{sec:WeakGravityConjecture} we discuss the weak gravity conjecture and axion inflation.
Conclusions are given in section \ref{sec:Conclusion}.
Some relevant papers related to this work can be found in \cite{BlancoPillado:2006he, Conlon:2005jm, Ben-Dayan:2014lca, Gao:2014uha}.

\section{Alignment mechanism \label{sec:Alignment}}
An early work using QCD axions is the so-called natural inflation where the inflation potential is of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:naturalInflationPotential}
  V\left(\phi\right) = \Lambda^4 \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right)\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and $f$ is the axion decay constant.
For a QCD axion $10^9 < f < 10^{12}$ GeV~\cite{Svrcek:2006yi}.
For inflation one requires $f > 7 M_\text{P}$~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}.
However, $f > M_\text{P}$ is undesirable since global symmetry is not preserved by quantum gravity unless it has a gauge origin.
Further, string theory prefers $f$ in the range $\left(10^{16} - 10^{18}\right)$ GeV~\cite{Svrcek:2006yi}.
Thus to get a successful natural inflation is difficult.

An interesting suggestion to realize $f < M_\text{P}$ is to use two axions and the alignment mechanism to achieve a flat direction~\cite{Long:2014dta}.
For a model with two axions $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ one considers a potential
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alignmentPotential}
  V(\phi)
    = \Lambda^4_1 \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{\phi_1}{f_1} + \frac{\phi_2}{f_2}\right)\right]
    + \Lambda^4_2 \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{\phi_1}{f_3} + \frac{\phi_2}{f_4}\right)\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Then, one imposes a constraint for a flat direction:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alignmentConstraint}
  \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{f_3}{f_4}\,,
\end{equation}
and considers small corrections to that constraint to produce a light inflaton.
Here, we discuss a coherent enhancement mechanism that can lead to an effective axion decay constant that controls inflation and is much larger than the true decay constant.
Further, we exhibit this phenomenon in models based on supersymmetry and supergravity.

\section{General Analysis of Coherent Enhancement Mechanism \label{sec:CoherentEnhancement}}
Before we discuss the Coherent Enhancement Mechanism (CEM) we derive a relation that gives the effective axion decay constant directly in terms of the inflationary parameters and in terms of the experimentally measurable spectral indices.
Thus we consider a canonical Lagrangian of the form
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}\left(\phi, \dot{\phi}\right) = \frac{1}{2}{\dot{\phi}}^2 - V\left(\phi\right)\,.
\end{equation}

Assuming the kinetic term is canonically normalized in each case, it is sufficient to have $V\left(\phi\right) \approx V_{e}\left(\phi\right)$ where $V_{e}\left(\phi\right)$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:naturalInflationPotential}) at $\phi \approx \phi_0$ to have similar evolution of the field and the scale factor near $\phi \sim \phi_0$.
Using this observation, we can express the parameters of natural inflation $\Lambda$ and $f_e$ in terms of various order derivatives of $V\left(\phi\right)$.
To do that, first, expand $V_{e}$ near $\phi_0$ to the second order so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:naturalInflationSeries}
  \begin{aligned}
    V_{e}\left(\phi\right) =
      &\Lambda \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{\phi_0}{f_e}\right)\right)
        + \frac{\Lambda}{f_e} \sin\left(\frac{\phi_0}{f_e}\right) \left(\phi - \phi_0\right)\\
      & + \frac{\Lambda}{2 f_e^2} \cos\left(\frac{\phi_0}{f_e}\right) \left(\phi - \phi_0\right)^2
        + \Lambda \mathcal{O}^3\left(\frac{\phi - \phi_0}{f_e}\right)\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, identifying the expansion coefficients in Eq.~(\ref{eq:naturalInflationSeries}) with corresponding derivatives of $V\left(\phi\right)$, and solving for $\Lambda$, $f_e$ and $\cos\left(\phi_0 / f_e\right)$, we obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lambdaFromPotential}
  \Lambda = V\left(\phi_0\right) \frac
    {{V^\prime}^2\left(\phi_0\right) - V\left(\phi_0\right) V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}
    {{V^\prime}^2\left(\phi_0\right) - 2 V\left(\phi_0\right) V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}
  \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feFromPotential}
  f_e = \frac
    {V\left(\phi_0\right)}
    {\sqrt{{V^\prime}^2\left(\phi_0\right)
      - 2 V\left(\phi_0\right) V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}}\,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fieldInitialFromPotential}
  \cos\left(\frac{\varphi_0}{f_e}\right) = \frac
    {V\left(\phi_0\right) V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}
    {{V^\prime}^2\left(\phi_0\right) - V\left(\phi_0\right) V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}\,.
\end{equation}
Here, we are mostly interested in Eq.~(\ref{eq:feFromPotential}), which gives the effective axion decay constant for the potential $V\left(\phi\right)$ near $\phi = \phi_0$.
Due to the second flatness condition, $\left|\eta\right| = M_\text{P}^2 \left|V_e^{\prime\prime} / V_e\right| = M_\text{P}^2 / f_e^2 \ll 1$, natural inflation can only generate experimentally consistent observables when $f_e \gg M_\text{P}$.
However, as discussed already the true axion decay constant larger than one is undesirable from considerations of quantum gravity and string theory \cite{Kallosh:1995hi, Banks:2003sx}.
Coherent Enhancement provides a solution in that the true axion decay constant can be smaller than one while the effective axion decay constant is larger or even much larger than one.

Finally, it is also possible to express the effective decay constant in terms of slow-roll inflation parameters $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ defined as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsEtaFromPotential}
  \epsilon =
    \frac{M_\text{P}^2}{2}
    \left(\frac{V^\prime\left(\phi_0\right)}{V\left(\phi_0\right)}\right)^2\,,
  ~~~ \eta = M_\text{P}^2 \frac{V^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi_0\right)}{V\left(\phi_0\right)}\,.
\end{equation}

By combining these with Eqs.~(\ref{eq:lambdaFromPotential}, \ref{eq:feFromPotential}, \ref{eq:fieldInitialFromPotential}), we obtain
\begin{align} % keep each equation numbered separately
  \label{eq:lambdaSlowRoll}
  \Lambda &= V\left(\phi_0\right) \frac{2 \epsilon - \eta}{2 \epsilon - 2 \eta}\,,\\
  \label{eq:feSlowRoll}
  f_e &= \frac{M_\text{P}}{\sqrt{2 \left(\epsilon - \eta\right)}}\,,\\
  \label{eq:fieldInitialSlowRoll}
  \cos\left(\frac{\varphi_0}{f_e}\right) &= \frac{\eta}{2 \epsilon - \eta}\,.
\end{align}

The spectral indices $n_s$ and $n_t$ are related to the inflationary parameters so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:observablesSlowRoll}
  n_s = 1 - 6 \epsilon + 2 \eta\,,
  ~~~ n_t = -2 \epsilon\,,
  ~~~ r = 16 \epsilon\,.
\end{equation}
We can thus eliminate $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ in favor of $n_s$ and $r$ and get
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feSpectralIndices}
  f_e = \frac{M_\text{P}}{\sqrt{1 - n_s - r / 4}}\,.
\end{equation}
The current experimental limits from Planck experiment at $k_0 = 0.05\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ are as follows~\cite{Akrami:2018vks, Akrami:2018odb, Array:2015xqh}
\begin{equation} \label{data}
  \begin{aligned}
    n_s &= 0.9649 \pm 0.0042\, \left(68\%\, {\rm CL}\right)\,,\\
      r &< 0.064\, \left(95\%\, {\rm CL}\right)\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
while $n_t\left(k_0\right)$ is currently not constrained.
Using this data we find model-independent bounds on the effective axionic decay constant so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feExperimentalConstraint}
  4.9 \leq f_e / M_\text{P} \leq 10.0\, \left(95\%\, {\rm CL}\right)\,.
\end{equation}

Next, we discuss the coherent enhancement mechanism arising from a superposition of cosine functions and show how the effective axion decay constant becomes super-Planckian even though the true decay constant is sub-Planckian.
As a specific simple example let us consider a potential of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cosineSumPotential}
  V = \sum_{k = 1}^n \Lambda_k^4 \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{k\phi}{f}\right)\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Here let us choose $\phi_0$ where the maximum occurs so that $\frac{\phi}{f} = \pi$.
In this case we get
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feForCosineSum}
  {f_e} / f = \frac
    {\sqrt{\sum_{k \in odd} \Lambda_k^4}}
    {\sqrt{\sum_{k \in odd} k^2 \Lambda_k^4 - \sum_{k \in even} k^2 \Lambda_k^4}}\,.
\end{equation}
One notices that there is cancellation between the odd and even sums in the denominator in Eq.~(\ref{eq:feForCosineSum}) which leads to an enhancement and gives $f_e / f > 1$.
Since the enhancement occurs as a consequence of the sum of several terms one may call this a ``coherent enhancement mechanism''.

It is also interesting to note that $n_s$, $r$, and therefore $f_e$ can be directly computed from the scale factor evolution without invoking any knowledge about the potential.
To distinguish the effective decay constant computed in this way from $f_e$ that is computed from potential, we will call it $f_{eH}$.

Specifically, we can define dynamic slow-roll parameters
\begin{equation} \label{eq:slowRollParametersDynamic}
  \epsilon_H = -\frac{\dot H}{H^2}\,,
  ~~~ \eta_H = -\frac{\dot{\epsilon_H}}{\epsilon_H H}\,.
\end{equation}

For the case when the velocity dependence of the parameters is relatively small one has
\begin{equation} \label{eq:slowRollParametersDynamicFromStatic}
  \epsilon_H = \epsilon\,,
  ~~~ \eta_H = -2 \eta + 4 \epsilon\,,
\end{equation}
in which case Eq.~(\ref{eq:feSlowRoll}) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feFromDynamicSlowRollParameters}
  f_{eH} = \frac{M_\text{P}}{\sqrt{\eta_H - 2 \epsilon_H}}\,.
\end{equation}

We will show using numerical simulations that $f_e \approx f_{eH}$ for the cases of global supersymmetry and supergravity.
The DBI inflation is discussed in \ref{sec:DBI}.
For the DBI case there is no analogue of $f_e$ since inflation in not controlled by the potential alone but by the full Lagrangian.
However, for DBI one may still define an $f_{eH}$ as given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:feFromDynamicSlowRollParameters}) which may be compared to the true axion decay constant that enters in the DBI lagrangian.

\section{Coherent enhancement mechanism in supersymmetry models \label{sec:Supersymmetry}}
In this section and the following sections we consider a variety of inflation models consistent with the current astrophysical data from the Planck experiment.
As mentioned in the introduction these models are in a variety of settings: global supersymmetry, supergravity and DBI.
In this section we focus on the globally supersymmetric models.
For the analysis here we consider a chiral field $\Phi$ charged under a global $U\left(1\right)$ transformation, and another field $\bar\Phi$ that is oppositely charged.
Thus under $U\left(1\right)$ transformations one has
\begin{equation}
  \Phi \to e^{i q \lambda} \Phi\,,
  ~~~ \bar\Phi \to e^{-i q \lambda} \bar\Phi\,.
\end{equation}
The superfield $\Phi$ has an expansion, $\Phi = \phi + \theta \chi + \theta \theta F$, where $\phi$ is a complex scalar field consisting of the saxion (the magnitude) and the axion (the phase), $\chi$ is the axino, and $F$ is an auxiliary field.
Similarly the superfield $\bar\Phi$ has an expansion: $\bar\Phi = \bar\phi + \bar\theta \bar\xi + \bar\theta \bar\theta \bar F$.
We now consider a superpotential of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supersymmetry:W}
  W = W_s\left(\Phi, \bar\Phi\right) + W_{sb}\left(\Phi, \bar\Phi\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $W_s$ is the part that depends on the fields $\Phi, \bar\Phi$ and is invariant under the shift symmetry.
$W_{sb}$ is a part which breaks the shift symmetry.
$W_s$ is chosen to stabilize the real parts of the chiral fields and we expand the chiral fields around the stabilized VEVs.
In this case we have
\begin{equation}
  W_s\left(\Phi, \bar\Phi\right) =
    \mu \Phi \bar\Phi + \frac{\lambda}{2 M} \left(\Phi \bar\Phi\right)^2\,.
\end{equation}
We may parametrize $\phi$ and $\bar\phi$ so that
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \left(f + \rho\right) e^{i a / f}\,,
  ~~~ \bar\phi = \left(\bar f + \bar\rho\right) e^{i \bar a / \bar f}\,,
\end{equation}
where $f = \left<\phi\right>$, $\bar f = \left<\bar\phi\right>$ and $\left(\rho, a\right)$ and $\left(\bar\rho, \bar a\right)$ are the fluctuations of the quantum fields around their vacuum expectation values $f$, $\bar f$.
We define two linear combinations of $a$ and $\bar a$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:b+-}
  b_{\pm}= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \left(a \pm \bar a\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Here $b_+$ is invariant under the shift symmetry and becomes heavy after the moduli are stabilized and $b_-$ is sensitive to shift symmetry and remains massless and we identify it as a candidate for the inflaton.

However, $b_-$ will gain mass when $W_{sb}$ is included in the analysis.
We will assume an $W_{sb}$ of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supersymmetry:Wsb}
  W_{sb}\left(\Phi, \bar\Phi\right) =
      \sum_{l = 1}^q A_l \Phi^l
    + \sum_{l = 1}^q \bar A_l \bar\Phi^l\,,
\end{equation}
which violates the shift symmetry.
Here we note that a similar procedure of using several non-perturbative terms to produce inflation by adjustment of parameters in the non-perturbative terms is used in the so-called `racetrack' models (see, e.g.,~\cite{BlancoPillado:2004ns, Lalak:2005hr, Greene:2005rn, BlancoPillado:2006he}).
Including $W_{sb}$ the axionic potential can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
  V\left(a, \bar a\right) = V_\text{fast}\left(b_+\right) + V_\text{slow}\left(b_-\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $V_\text{slow}\left(b_-\right)$ which depends only on $b_-$ enters in slow roll and is relevant for inflation.

Note, the values of the parameters $\mu$ and $\lambda / M$ determine the stability point $f$.
We can equivalently however fix $f$ and solve for $\lambda / M$ in terms of $\mu$ and $f$.
It turns out $\mu$ only appears in $V_\text{fast}$, but not in $V_\text{slow}$, for which an explicit form is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supersymmetry:VslowGeneral}
  \begin{aligned}
    V_\text{slow}\left(b_-\right) =
      &2 \sum_{r = 1}^q r
        \left(A_r f^{r - 1} \sum_{l = 1}^q l A_l f^{l - 1}
          + \bar A_r f^{r - 1} \sum_{l = 1}^q l \bar A_l f^{l - 1}\right)
        \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt 2 f} b_-\right)\right)\\
      &{} - 2 \sum_{l = 1}^q \sum_{r = l + 1}^q
        l r \left(A_l A_r f^{l + r - 2} + \bar A_l \bar A_r f^{l + r - 2}\right)
        \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r - l}{\sqrt 2 f} b_-\right)\right)\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we have set $\bar f = f$.
We make now further simplifying assumptions so that $A_l = \bar A_l = B_l f^{3 - l}$, $B_l = B G_l$.
Thus $B_l$, $B$, $G_l$ are dimensionless while $f$ carries dimension of mass.
Using the above assumptions the potential of Eq.~(\ref{eq:supersymmetry:VslowGeneral}) takes a simpler form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supersymmetry:Vslow}
  \begin{aligned}
    V_\text{slow}\left(b_-\right) = 4 f^4 B^2 &\left(
      \sum_{l = 1}^q l G_l \sum_{r = 1}^q r G_r
        \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{b_-}{f}\right)\right)\right. \\
      &\left.{} - \sum_{l = 1}^q \sum_{r = l + 1}^q l r G_l G_r
        \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r - l}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{b_-}{f}\right)\right)
    \right)\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

    Also note that the field change during inflation $\Delta b_- < f \le M_\text{P}$.
    Inflation occurs in the flat region of the potential near $b_- / f \approx 3$.

\end{figure}

In order to verify consistency with experiment and evaluate $f_e$, we use Inflation Simulator\footnote{\url{https://github.com/maxitg/InflationSimulator}}.
For these simulations we begin by sampling a number of parameter sets as described in the caption of Fig.~(\ref{fig:supersymmetry}).
We then use the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \dot b_-^2 - V_\text{slow}\left(b_-\right)$ and Friedmann equations described in section~4 of~\cite{Nath:2018xxe} to simulate evolution of the field and the scale factor.
We set initial field velocity $\dot b_{-, \text{init}} = 0$, and check that at least $N_\text{pivot} + N_\text{subhorizont}$ e-foldings are produced, where $N_\text{subhorizon} = 5$ is added to ensure velocity converges to its quasi-stationary value before horizon exit.
Finally, if we have sufficient number of e-foldings, we compute the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at horizon exit (i.e., $N_\text{pivot}$ e-foldings before the end of inflation) using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:slowRollParametersDynamic}, \ref{eq:slowRollParametersDynamicFromStatic}, \ref{eq:observablesSlowRoll}), and check if they are consistent with experimental constraints~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}.
If so, we evaluate $f_e$ and $f_{eH}$ at horizon exit using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:feFromPotential}, \ref{eq:feFromDynamicSlowRollParameters}).
The results of this process can be seen on Fig.~(\ref{fig:supersymmetry}).

One can see that even though true decay constant $f$ is below $M_\text{P}$, the effective $f_e \approx f_{eH}$ always satisfy constraint \ref{eq:feExperimentalConstraint}.
We find the relative difference between two effective decay constants $\left|f_e - f_{eH}\right| / f_e \le \protect\input{figures/supersymmetryfRelativeDifferenceMax.txt}$.
Note, fine tuning of $G_5$ is required to achieve coherent enhancement and experimentally-consistent inflation.

\section{Enhancement mechanism in supergravity \label{sec:Supergravity}}
We now extend the analysis to supergravity where the scalar potential has the form~\cite{Chamseddine:1982jx, Cremmer:1982en}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supergravity:potential}
  V = e^{K / M_\text{P}^2} \left[
    D_i W K^{-1}_{ij^*} D_{j^*} W^* - \frac{3}{M_\text{P}^2} \left|W\right|^2
  \right] + V_D\,,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the K\"ahler potential, $W$ as before is the superpotential, and $D_i W$ is defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supergravity:DW}
  D_i W = \frac{\partial W}{\partial \phi_i}
        + \frac{1}{M_\text{P}^2} \frac{\partial K}{\partial \phi_i} W\,.
\end{equation}
$V_D$, which is the $D$-term of the potential, will play no role in our analysis and will be dropped from here on.
In order to avoid the so-called $\eta$-problem of supergravity we choose the K\"ahler potential to be of the form
\begin{equation}
  K = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} \left(\Phi_i + \Phi_i^\dagger\right)^2\,,
\end{equation}
where we consider a pair of chiral fields $\Phi_i, i = 1, 2$.
We parametrize the complex scalar components $\phi_i$ of the fields as
\begin{equation}
  \phi_i = \left(\rho_i + i a_i\right) / \sqrt 2,
  ~~~ i = 1, 2\,,
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ have the shift symmetry
\begin{equation}
  a_1 \to a_1 + \lambda,
  ~~~ a_2 \to a_2 - \lambda\,,
\end{equation}
and $\rho_i$ are the saxion fields.
It is then easily checked that the kinetic energy for $\phi_i$ and $a_i$ is canonically normalized.
As in the global supersymmetry case we choose $W$ of the form Eq.~(\ref{eq:supersymmetry:W}) where, however, we write
\begin{equation}
  W_s = W_s^\text{vis} + W_0\,,
\end{equation}
where $W_s$ is invariant under the shift symmetry with $W_s^\text{vis}$ arising from the visible sector
\begin{equation}
  W_s^\text{vis} =
      \frac{\mu}{2} \left(\Phi_1 + \Phi_2\right)^2
    + \frac{\lambda}{3} \left(\Phi_1 + \Phi_2\right)^3\,,
\end{equation}
and $W_0$ arising from the hidden sector. We set $W_0$ in a way that $W = 0$ if $a_i = 0$, which ensures vanishing of the vacuum energy at the end of inflation.
For supergravity analysis the saxion can be stabilized by imposition of spontaneous symmetry breaking conditions~\cite{Nath:1983aw}
\begin{equation}
  D_i W = 0,
  ~~~ i = 1, 2\,.
\end{equation}
For shift symmetry breaking we assume
\begin{equation}
  W_{sb} = \sum_{n = 1}^q A_n \left(e^{c_n \Phi_1} + e^{c_n \Phi_2}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and as in the global supersymmetry case we make a change of basis from $a_1, a_2$ to $b_+, b_-$ as given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:b+-}), where $a$ and $\bar a$ are replaced with $a_1$ and $a_2$ respectively.
Next we expand around the minimum of the saxion potential and retain only $b_-$ which controls the slow-roll part of the potential.
To that end $W_{sb}$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
  W_{sb} = \sum_{n = 1}^q A_n \left(
      e^{i \gamma_n \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}}
    + e^{-i \gamma_n \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}}
  \right)\,,
\end{equation}
where we take $\gamma_n = c_n f / \sqrt{2}$.
In this case the slow-roll part of the potential which involves only the field $b_-$ takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supergravity:Vslow}
  \begin{aligned}
    V\left(b_-\right) =
      & 4 M_\text{P}^4 e^{2 f^2 / M_\text{P}^2} \sum_{n = 1}^q \sum_{m = 1}^q
        e^{\gamma_n + \gamma_m} \frac{A_n A_m}{M_\text{P}^6}\\
        &{} \times \left[
          \gamma_n \gamma_m \frac{M_\text{P}^2}{f^2} \left(
              1
            - \cos\left(\gamma_n \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
            - \cos\left(\gamma_m \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
            + \cos\left(\left(\gamma_n - \gamma_m\right) \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
          \right)\right.\\
          &~~~~~~ + \left(2 \gamma_n + 2 \gamma_m - 3 + 4 \frac{f^2}{M_\text{P}^2}\right) \left(
              1
            - \cos\left(\gamma_n \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
            - \cos\left(\gamma_m \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)\right.\\
            &~~~~~~~~~~~~ \left.\left.{}
            + \frac{1}{2} \cos\left(\left(\gamma_n - \gamma_m\right) \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
            + \frac{1}{2} \cos\left(\left(\gamma_n + \gamma_m\right) \frac{b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
          \right)
        \right]\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
For our analysis we take $\gamma_n = n$ and $q = 3$, which is the minimal value with which we were able to achieve experimentally-consistent inflation.
In that case the above potential consists of a superposition of six cosines so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supergravity:Vslow3}
  V\left(b_-\right)
    = M_\text{P}^4 e^{2 f^2 / M_\text{P}^2} \sum_{k = 1}^6 C_k \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{k b_-}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $C_k$ are given by

    \right)\,,\\

Simulation results for this potential are similar to the global supersymmetry model and are shown on Fig.~(\ref{fig:supergravity}).
In this model, we find $\left|f_e - f_{eH}\right| / f_e \le \protect\input{figures/supergravityfRelativeDifferenceMax.txt}$.

\section{Coherent Enhancement Mechanism for Dirac-Born-Infeld \label{sec:DBI}}
Supersymmetric DBI actions have been investigated by a number of authors (see, e.g.,~\cite{Khoury:2010gb, Khoury:2011da, Baumann:2011nk, Baumann:2011nm, Rocek:1997hi, Tseytlin:1999dj, Ito:2007hy, Billo:2008sp, Sasaki:2012ka, Aoki:2016tod}.
Here we discuss the supersymmetric DBI in the context of axion inflation.
Inflation in a single field DBI has discussed in~\cite{Sasaki:2012ka} and for the case of two fields in~\cite{Nath:2018xxe}.
Here we discuss the coherent enhancement mechanism in the context of the two fields.
Thus as in our analysis in sections 4 and 5 we consider a pair of chiral superfields $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ which carry opposite charges under a global $U\left(1\right)$ symmetry.
The supersymmetric Lagrangian involving $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:DBI:lagrangianTerms}
  \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_D + \mathcal{L}_F\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_D$ is the $D$-part of the Lagrangian and $\mathcal{L}_F$ is the $F$-part.
Here $\mathcal{L}_D$ consists of a part which is quadratic in the fields and a part which is quartic in the fields so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:DBI:lagrangianD}
  \mathcal{L}_D = \sum_{k = 1}^2 \left(\int d^4 \theta \Phi_k \Phi_k^\dagger
    + \int d^4 \theta \frac{\alpha_1}{16 T}
      \left(D^\alpha \Phi_k D_\alpha \Phi_k\right)
      \left({\bar D}^{\dot\alpha} \Phi_k^\dagger {\bar D}_{\dot\alpha} \Phi_k^\dagger\right)
      G\left(\phi\right)\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  G\left(\phi\right) = \frac{1}{T} \frac{1}{1 + P + \sqrt{\left(1 + P\right)^2 - Q}}\,,
\end{equation}
and $P$ and $Q$ are assumed to have the following forms
\begin{equation} \label{eq:DBI:PQ}
  \begin{aligned}
    P &= \left(
        \partial_a \phi_1 \partial^a \phi^*_1
      + \partial_a \phi_2 \partial^a \phi^*_2
    \right) / T\,,\\
    Q &= \left(
        \alpha_1 \partial_a \phi_1 \partial^a \phi_1 \partial_b \phi^*_1 \partial^b \phi^*_1
      + \alpha_1 \partial_a \phi_2 \partial^a \phi_2 \partial_b \phi^*_2 \partial^b \phi^*_2
    \right) / T^2\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We note that the Lagrangian of Eq.~(\ref{eq:DBI:lagrangianD}) is a direct generalization of the Lagrangian for the single field case which can be derived from a more basic 3-brane action (see, e.g.,~\cite{Rocek:1997hi, Tseytlin:1999dj, Sasaki:2012ka} and the references therein).
Here we simply extend the analysis to two fields in the most general supersymmetric form involving four covariant derivatives.
In writing Eq.~(\ref{eq:DBI:lagrangianD}) we imposed an additional constraint which is invariance under $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ interchange.
The possible relation of this Lagrangian to an underlying string model is an open question.
Here we simply treat Eq.~(\ref{eq:DBI:lagrangianD}) as an effective low energy theory.
Finally $\mathcal{L}_F$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_F = \int d^2 \theta W\left(\Phi_1, \Phi_2\right)
                + \int d^2 \bar\theta W^*\left(\Phi_1^\dagger, \Phi_2^\dagger\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where the superpotential $W$ as in earlier analyses is given by $W = W_s + W_{sb}$, and where
\begin{equation}
W_s = \mu \Phi_1 \Phi_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \left(\Phi_1 \Phi_2\right)^2
\end{equation}
is chosen so that we can stabilize the saxion VEVs and $W_{sb}$ breaks the global $U\left(1\right)$ symmetry and is taken to be of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dbi:Wsb}
  W_{sb} = \sum_{k = 1}^m \left(A_{1, k} \Phi_1^k + A_{2, k} \Phi_2^k\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Integration over the Grassmann variables gives rise to the following Lagrangian
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dbi:lagrangianIntermediate}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L} =
      & T - T \sqrt{\left(1 + A\right)^2 - B} + F_1 F^*_1 + F_2 F^*_2\\
      &+ G\left(\phi\right) \left[
        \alpha_1 \left(
          - 2 F_1 F^*_1 \partial_a \phi_1 \partial^a \phi^*_1
          + F_1^2 {F^*_1}^2
        \right)\right.\\
        &~~~ \left.{} + \alpha_1 \left(
          - 2 F_2 F^*_2 \partial_a \phi_2 \partial^a \phi^*_2
          + F_2^2 {F^*_2}^2
        \right)\right]\\
      &+ \left(
          \frac{\partial W}{\partial \phi_1} F_1
        + \frac{\partial W}{\partial \phi_2} F_2
        + h.c.
      \right)\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
There are four auxiliary fields in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dbi:lagrangianIntermediate}) which are $F_1$, $F^*_1$, $F_2$, $F^*_2$.
The auxiliary fields $F_k$ satisfy the cubic equation
\begin{equation}
  F_k^3 + p_k F_k + q_k = 0\,,
  ~~~ k = 1, 2\,,
\end{equation}
where $p_k$, $q_k$ are defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:DBI:pq}
  \begin{aligned}
    p_k &=
      \left(\frac{\partial W}{\partial \phi_k}\right)^{-1}
      \frac{\partial W^*}{\partial \phi^*_k}
      \frac
        {1 - 2 \alpha_1 G\left(\phi\right) \partial_\mu \phi_k \partial^\mu \phi_k}
        {2 \alpha_1 G\left(\phi\right)}\,,\\
    q_k &=
      \frac{1}{2 \alpha_1 G\left(\phi\right)}
      \left(\frac{\partial W}{\partial \phi_k}\right)^{-1}
      \left(\frac{\partial W^*}{\partial \phi^*_k}\right)^2\,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Since $F_k$ satisfies a cubic equation, it has three roots which are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:DBI:F}
  \begin{aligned}
    F_k = &\omega^j \left(
      - \frac{q_k}{2}
      + \sqrt{\left(\frac{q_k}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p_k}{3}\right)^3}\right)^{1 / 3}\\
    & + \omega^{3 - j} \left(
      - \frac{q_k}{2}
      - \sqrt{\left(\frac{q_k}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p_k}{3}\right)^3}\right)^{1 / 3}\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the cube root of unity and $j = 0, 1, 2$.
It turns out that of the three roots only $j = 0$ is a solution to the full Euler-Lagrange equations for $F_k$ and in our analysis we consider only this solution.

An explicit computation of the Lagrangian in this case is given in~\cite{Nath:2018xxe} and displayed in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dbi:lagrangian}).
The Lagrangian depends on a single axion field $b_-$ defined as in the preceding sections and 5 parameters $T$, $\alpha_1$, $f$, $\tilde\beta$, and a vector $\mathcal{G}$ as discussed below.
Thus we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dbi:lagrangian}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\mathcal{L}\left(T, \alpha_1, f, \beta, G; b_-, \dot{b_-}\right) = T \left(
        1
      - \sqrt{
          1
        - \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{T}
        + \frac{\left(2 - \alpha_1\right) {\dot b}_-^4}{8 T^2}
      }\right.\\
      &~~~ \left.{}
      + 2 \mathcal{F}_+^2
      + 2 \mathcal{F}_-^2
      - \frac{4}{3 \alpha_1} \left(
        \mathcal{T} + \left(\alpha_1 - 1\right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}
      \right)
      + 4 k \left(\mathcal{F}_+ + \mathcal{F}_-\right)\right.\\
      &~~~ \left.{}
      + \frac{\alpha_1}{\mathcal{T} - {\dot b}_-^2 / \left(4 T\right)}\left(
          2 \left(
              \mathcal{F}_+^2
            + \mathcal{F}_-^2
            - \frac{2}{3 \alpha_1}
              \left(\mathcal{T} + \left(\alpha_1 - 1\right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}\right)
          \right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}
        + \mathcal{F}_+^4\right.\right.\\
        &~~~~~~ \left.\left.{}
        + \mathcal{F}_-^4
        + \frac{2}{3 \alpha_1^2}
          \left(\mathcal{T} + \left(\alpha_1 - 1\right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}\right)^2
        - \frac{4}{3 \alpha_1}
          \left(\mathcal{T} + \left(\alpha_1 - 1\right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}\right)
          \left(\mathcal{F}_+^2 + \mathcal{F}_-^2\right)
      \right)
    \right)\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{F}_\pm = \pm &\left(
      \mp\frac{1}{2 \alpha_1} k \left(\mathcal{T} - \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}\right)\right.\\
      &\left.{} + \sqrt{
          \frac{1}{4 \alpha_1^2} k^2 \left(\mathcal{T} - \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}\right)^2
        + \frac{1}{27 \alpha_1^3} \left(
            \mathcal{T}
          + \left(\alpha_1 - 1\right) \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{4 T}
        \right)^3
      }
    \right)^{1 / 3}\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and where
\begin{align} % keep each equation numbered separately
  \mathcal{T} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(
      1
    + \sqrt{1 - \frac{{\dot b}_-^2}{T} + \frac{\left(2 - \alpha_1\right){\dot b}_-^4}{8 T^2}}
  \right)\,,\\
  \label{eq:dbi:beta}
  k &= \tilde\beta \sqrt{\sum_{m, n} m n \mathcal{G}_m \mathcal{G}_n \left(
      1
    - \cos\left(\frac{b_- m}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
    - \cos\left(\frac{b_- n}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
    + \cos\left(\frac{b_- \left(m - n\right)}{\sqrt{2} f}\right)
  \right)}\,,\\
  \mathcal{G}_k &= \frac{A_k 2^{1 / 2 \left(1 - k\right)}}{\tilde\beta \sqrt{T} f^{1 - k}}\,.
\end{align}

We note that the parameter $\tilde\beta$ here is redundant, and is chosen in such a way as to make $\mathcal{G}_k \sim 1$.
The first non-zero component of $\mathcal{G}$ can also be set to $1$ to reduce redundancy.
Further, we note that Eqs.~(\ref{eq:epsEtaFromPotential}) will not be sufficient to describe evolution in this case, because they do not take the form of kinetic energy into account.
However, we will use Eqs.~(\ref{eq:slowRollParametersDynamic}) which are independent of the kinetic terms, therefore, we conjecture that while Eqs.~(\ref{eq:slowRollParametersDynamicFromStatic}) do not hold, Eq.~(\ref{eq:feFromDynamicSlowRollParameters}) can still be used to derive an effective decay constant, where Eqs.~(\ref{eq:slowRollParametersDynamic}) are used to derive $\epsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$.

To demonstrate the validity of our procedure, we sample the parameter space of the model Eq.~(\ref{eq:dbi:lagrangian}) by setting $T = 1$, $\mathcal{G}_1 = \mathcal{G}_2 = \mathcal{G}_3 = 0$, $\mathcal{G}_4 = 1$, and varying $\mathcal{G}_5$, $\mathcal{G}_6$, $\alpha_1$, $f$, $\tilde\beta$, and the pivot e-foldings count $N_\text{pivot}$.
This corresponds to Fig.~(1) of~\cite{Nath:2018xxe}.
We then select parameter choices than produced at least $N_\text{pivot}$ number of e-foldings, and plot the true axion decay constant $f$ vs. the effective axion decay constant $f_e$ on Fig.~(\ref{fig:DBI}).

Simulation results for DBI are shown on Fig.~(\ref{fig:DBI}).
Here we reuse the simulation results displayed in Fig~(1) of~\cite{Nath:2018xxe}, however, we update experimental constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and scalar spectral index $n_s$ to Planck 2018 results~\cite{Akrami:2018odb}, and compute the values of $f_{eH}$ using Eq.~(\ref{eq:feSpectralIndices}).
Note that even though $f_e$ cannot be defined in this model, $f_{eH}$ still satisfies Eq.~(\ref{eq:feExperimentalConstraint}).

\section{Tensor-to-scalar power spectra ratios in single-field models \label{sec:r}}
It is interesting to observe that the values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \ll 1$ in global supersymmetry Fig.~(\ref{fig:supersymmetry}) and supergravity Fig.~(\ref{fig:supergravity}) models we considered, but is close to experimental limit $r \approx 0.1$ for some points in the DBI model Fig.~(\ref{fig:DBI}).

To see why, consider first an arbitrary single-field inflation model with canonical kinetic energy.
For the number of e-foldings we have:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:efoldingsGeneral}
  N = \frac{1}{M_\text{P}} \int \sqrt{\rho / 3}\,dt
    = \frac{1}{M_\text{P}} \int \sqrt{\rho / 3}\,\frac{d\phi}{\dot \phi}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the density of the inflaton field $\phi$.

In slow-roll approximation $\ddot \phi \approx 0$, and ${\dot \phi}^2 \ll V\left(\phi\right)$, then using equations of motion we obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:efoldingsCanonical}
  N = - \frac{1}{M_\text{P}^2} \int \frac{V\left(\phi\right)}{V^\prime\left(\phi\right)} d\phi
    \approx - \frac{\Delta \phi}{M_\text{P} \sqrt{2 \epsilon}}\,,
\end{equation}
where we used the definition of the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$, see Eq.~(\ref{eq:epsEtaFromPotential}).

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{
    Evolution of density as a function of the number of e-foldings until the end of inflation for global supersymmetry (top left panel), supergravity (top right panel) and DBI (bottom panel) models.
    Examples with the largest values of the ratio $r$ of tensor-to-scalar power spectra are chosen in each case.
    Here $\rho_0$ is the density at the beginning of the simulation, and the number of e-foldings is shown negative for convenience as $N - N_\text{total} < 0$.
    Horizon exit occurs at $-60 < N - N_\text{total} < -50$.
    Note at that point, the density in global supersymmetry and supergravity models changes much slower than in DBI, which explains smaller values of $r$ in these models.
  } \label{fig:density}
\end{figure}

If we now require $\Delta \phi < M_\text{P}$, which for types of models we consider implies $f \lesssim M_\text{P}$, we get the Lyth bound~\cite{Lyth:1996im}
\begin{equation}
  r < \frac{8 \Delta \phi^2}{M_\text{P}^2 N^2} \lesssim 0.003\,,
\end{equation}
which is what we see in Figs.~(\ref{fig:supersymmetry}, \ref{fig:supergravity}).
Note also $\Delta\phi$ is larger in the supergravity model, which is consistent with it also producing larger values of $r$.
The density in that case stays nearly constant at horizon exit since
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon \approx \epsilon_H
           = - \frac{\dot H}{H^2}
           = - \frac{8 \sqrt{3} \dot\rho M_\text{P}}{\rho^{3 / 2}}
           \propto \dot\rho\,,
\end{equation}
which can be seen in the top panels of Fig.~(\ref{fig:density}).

In the case of DBI, however, Eq.~(\ref{eq:efoldingsCanonical}) is not valid, rather, $\dot\phi$ in the denominator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:efoldingsGeneral}) is suppressed by the kinetic term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dbi:lagrangian} as $\rho \rightarrow \infty$ for $\phi = b_- \rightarrow b_{-, \text{max}} \sim \sqrt{T} / M_\text{P}$.
It is then possible to obtain a large number of e-foldings by increasing $\rho$, which can be done for example by having $\tilde\beta \gg 1$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dbi:beta}).
Since small $\rho^\prime\left(\phi\right)$ is no longer necessary, it is possible to get the values of $r$ as high as the experimental limit.
One can indeed see from the bottom panel of Fig.~(\ref{fig:density}) that the density changes more uniformly in the case of DBI compared to other models.

\section{The Weak gravity conjecture and axion inflation \label{sec:WeakGravityConjecture}}
In its simplest form the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) considers the coupling of an abelian gauge field with gravity and states that this system must contain a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ so that~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2006dz} $\frac{q}{m} > \frac{1}{M_\text{P}}$.
The existence of such a particle is needed to carry away the charge of a black hole to avoid the remnant problem when the black hole evaporates due to Hawking radiation.
An alternate way to describe the constraint is to define the parameter $z = \frac{q M_\text{P}}{m}$ and in this case the WGC constraint implies $z > 1$.
The WGC constraint can be extended to the case where there are several abelian gauge groups~\cite{Cheung:2014vva} $\prod_{\alpha = 1}^N U\left(1\right)_\alpha$ with each $U\left(1\right)_\alpha$ having particles of charges $q_\alpha$ and masses $m_\alpha$.
In this case the allowed parameter space of masses and charges must lie outside a convex hull which contains the unit ball whose boundary corresponds to an extremal black hole where for the extremal black hole $z_\text{BH} = \frac{Q M_\text{P}}{M} = 1$ and where $Q$ is the black hole charge and $M$ its mass.
The above constraint is found to be consistent with string theory and thus one might argue that consistent theories of quantum gravity obey the weak gravity conjecture.
Specifically, for example, one cannot let the charge $q_\alpha$ become arbitrarily small since in that case in the limit one will have a continuous global symmetry which is forbidden by strings.

So far the analysis concerns just the abelian gauge theories coupling with gravity.
However, there are implications also for the axions and axionic inflation.
The constraints of the WGC for axions are more indirectly arrived at and there is less unanimity regarding what their implications are.
Thus even before WGC, Bank et al.~\cite{Banks:2003sx} analyzed a number of periodic fields in string theory for various string vacua and found that an axion decay constant larger than the Planck mass was undesirable.
Several works have since analyzed the implications of WGC for the axions.
One approach maps the constraint on charge to mass conjectured by WGC to the ratio of instanton action and the axion decay constant~\cite{Brown:2015iha} using $T$-duality.
Another approach involves dimensional reduction in an effort to extract the constraint of WGC for the axion decay constant~\cite{Heidenreich:2015wga}.
For the simplest case of a single axion field a decay constant in the trans-Planckian region appears improbable.
For the most general case of multiple axions with kinetic mixings and more general form for arguments in the cosines, the analysis is somewhat ambiguous.
There is a significant literature associated with this topic~\cite{Rudelius:2015xta, Rudelius:2014wla, Bachlechner:2014gfa, Choi:2014rja, Hebecker:2015rya, Conlon:2016aea, Montero:2015ofa, Junghans:2015hba}.

In this work we assume that WGC holds in the axion sector and implies that $f_i < M_\text{P}$ for any number of canonically normalized axion fields.
However, we show that two (or more) axion fields which transform under a $U\left(1\right)$ global symmetry along with non-perturbative symmetry breaking terms can enter in coherent enhancement of the effective decay constant during the inflationary period.
It differs from the alignment mechanism in that it does not rely on Eq.~(\ref{eq:alignmentConstraint}) to create a flat direction.
A massless inflaton is generated by an underlying $U\left(1\right)$ symmetry which is then broken by instanton like terms producing a potential for the inflaton field.
The enhancement occurs from a superposition of several cosine terms, as can be seen from Eq.~(\ref{eq:supersymmetry:Vslow}) for the global supersymmetry case, and from Eq.~(\ref{eq:supergravity:Vslow3}) for the supergravity case.
In section \ref{sec:CoherentEnhancement}, we show that for any model with canonical kinetic energy and a potential which is not velocity dependent, that an enhancement of the axion decay constant can be achieved by superposition of several terms which break the $U\left(1\right)$ global symmetry.
The enhancement arises from constructive and destructive interference among the various terms as shown in Eq.~(\ref{eq:feForCosineSum}).
In section \ref{sec:CoherentEnhancement} we also show that the current experimental data requires the effective decay constant to lie in the trans-Planckian region $4.9 < f_e / M_\text{P} < 10.0$.
We construct explicit models which obey this experimental constraint using the coherent enhancement mechanism while the true decay constant lies in the sub-Planckian region consistent with the WGC constraint.
All the moduli are stabilized in the analysis.

In addition to the above we have investigated the supersymmetric DBI model.
Here the normal analysis using the potential alone does not work and one must utilize the full Lagrangian.
In this case we show that consistent inflation can occur with the true decay constant which is sub-Planckian and further we provide a workable definition of the effective decay constant in terms of the inflation parameters $n_s$ and $r$.
The WGC constraints in this case are unknown, and it is of interest to investigate them for DBI inflation.
We note that our analysis of DBI is in the spirit of an effective theory.
The analyses in these models use sub-Planckian decay constants, all the moduli are fully stabilized and generate inflation consistent with the current cosmological data.
It is of interest to show that UV completion of these models could be constructed and lie in the string landscape.

\section{Conclusion \label{sec:Conclusion}}
One of the possible candidates for inflation is an axion.
However, axion models with a simple cosine potential require an axion decay constant which is super-Planckian in size which is not favored in quantum gravity and strings.
One early proposal to overcome this problem is the so called alignment mechanism where one considers two or more axion fields and imposes certain constraints on the decay constants.
Here we propose a new mechanism, the coherent enhancement mechanism, which allows one to produce an effective decay constant which governs inflation to be much larger than the true decay constant.
The mechanism utilizes the symmetry breaking part which generates the axion potential, is quite general and applies naturally to inflaton potentials arising in models based in supersymmetry, supergravity and strings.
The analysis is extended to inflation in supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld model which, however, is more complex since inflation is governed not just by the potential but the Lagrangian.
One of the interesting results of the analysis is that the effective decay constant can be directly related to the spectral indices as exhibited by Eq.~(\ref{eq:feSpectralIndices}).
The analysis presented in this work shows that in all the cases considered axion inflation consistent with the experimental data can be accomplished with the true axion decay constant in the sub-Planckian domain in conformity with the Weak Gravity Conjecture.
